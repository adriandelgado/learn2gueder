This is a compilation of small projects done together with the members of
the club in order to develop de basic programming skills that allow us to
be competitive in different types of contests, and also just for fun :).

Each subdirectory contains a different project, which themselves contain
subdirectories pertaining to the different implementations contributed by
each of the club members.
